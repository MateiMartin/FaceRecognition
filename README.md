# FaceRecognition

This repository contains the front-end code for the FaceRecognition application. The application is built using Vite and Tachyons.

## Description

The FaceRecognition application is designed to recognize and detect faces in images. It utilizes a server-side API provided by the [FaceRecognition-API](https://github.com/MateiMartin/FaceRecognition-API.git) repository. The front-end code in this repository interacts with the server to send images and receive the face detection results.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in this project include:

- Vite: Vite is a fast and opinionated build tool for modern web applications. It provides a highly efficient development environment with instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR).
- Tachyons: Tachyons is a functional CSS framework that enables rapid prototyping and development of responsive and scalable user interfaces. It follows a "design-systems" approach and offers a wide range of pre-built utility classes for styling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the FaceRecognition application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the [FaceRecognition-API](https://github.com/MateiMartin/FaceRecognition-API.git) repository.
2. Set up and start the server according to the instructions provided in the repository's README file.
3. Clone this repository (FaceRecognition) to your local machine.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to the specified development server address (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

Also,  the app and the corresponding server are hosted on Render.
